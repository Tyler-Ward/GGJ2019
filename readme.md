### About

Municipal Darwinism is a game about collecting and managing resources as you try to build your mobile house to be larger than any other. Prey on smaller houses for their components, but fear larger ones as they can just as easily disassemble you!

### How to play

#### Controls:
* W - Accelerate
* A - Turn Left
* S - Reverse
* D - Turn Right
* Space/Enter - Start Game

You control your home. Try to build the most prestigious home you can and survive! Collect new parts for your home by driving around and picking them up to attach them to your home. You gain fuel by destroying trees. You use more fuel when having more tracks, but that helps you keep your house stable. You will lose if you run out of fuel, become too unstable and fall over or flood your house under water. Try to get as many points as possible!
